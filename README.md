# Logic-Gates
Python classes for logic gates implementation

I try to implement Base Gates for logic circuits simultaions. 
I made some experiment. I study logic gates functionality mixing togheder to reacreate some cpompless circuits.
In the file adder.py you can find an 8 bits adder assembled with Base Gates Classes from gates.py.
