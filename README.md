# Logic-Gates
Python classes for logic gates implementation

I try to implement Base Gates for simulation of logic circuits. 
I made some experiment with this to show logic gates functionality and mixing togheder to reacreate some cpompless circuits.
In the second file adder.py i try to simulate an 8 bits adder assembled with Base Gates Classes.
